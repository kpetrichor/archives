# Cryptography and System Security Lab Experiments


1. Design and Implementation of a product cipher using Substitution and
Transposition ciphers

2. Implementation and analysis of RSA public key cryptosystem and Digital
signature scheme.

3. Implementation of Diffie Hellman Key exchange algorithm

4. For varying message sizes, test integrity of message using MD-5, SHA-1, and
analyse the performance of the two protocols. Use crypt APIs

11. Simulate buffer overflow attack using Splint, Cppcheck etc

12. Implementation of password strength checker.
